# NIP-46 Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented NIP-46 (Nostr Remote Signing) support in NDKSwift. The implementation supports both `bunker://` and `nostrconnect://` flows, following the pattern used in the TypeScript @ndk/ndk-core implementation.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. **NDKBunkerSigner.swift** (New)
   - Main implementation of the NIP-46 signer
   - Supports all three connection methods:
     - `bunker://` URL connection tokens
     - `nostrconnect://` URI generation for QR codes
     - NIP-05 address lookup
   - Implements full NDKSigner protocol with remote signing capabilities
   - Uses actor-based concurrency for thread safety

### 2. **Supporting Infrastructure**
   - Added `NDKEncryptionScheme` enum to Types.swift
   - Extended NDKSigner protocol with encryption/decryption methods
   - Added `nip46Urls` property to NDKUser for relay discovery
   - Added `publish(event:to:)` method to NDK for specific relay publishing
   - Created RPC client infrastructure within NDKBunkerSigner

## Key Features Implemented

### Connection Methods

1. **Bunker URL Flow**
   ```swift
   let signer = NDKBunkerSigner.bunker(
       ndk: ndk, 
       connectionToken: "bunker://79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798?relay=wss%3A%2F%2Frelay.nsec.app&secret=VpESbyIFohMA"
   )
   let user = try await signer.connect()
   ```

2. **NostrConnect Flow**
   ```swift
   let options = NDKBunkerSigner.NostrConnectOptions(
       name: "My App",
       url: "https://myapp.com",
       perms: "sign_event,nip04_encrypt"
   )
   let signer = NDKBunkerSigner.nostrConnect(
       ndk: ndk,
       relay: "wss://relay.nsec.app",
       options: options
   )
   // Display signer.nostrConnectUri as QR code
   ```

3. **NIP-05 Flow**
   ```swift
   let signer = NDKBunkerSigner.nip05(ndk: ndk, nip05: "user@example.com")
   let user = try await signer.connect()
   ```

### Supported Operations

- ✅ Remote event signing
- ✅ NIP-04 encryption/decryption  
- ✅ NIP-44 encryption/decryption (fallback)
- ✅ Get public key
- ✅ Auth URL handling via Combine publisher
- ✅ Automatic reconnection handling
- ✅ RPC message encryption/decryption

## Testing

The provided bunker connection string can be tested with:

```swift
let bunkerString = "bunker://79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798?relay=wss%3A%2F%2Frelay.nsec.app&secret=VpESbyIFohMA"

let ndk = NDK(relayUrls: ["wss://relay.nsec.app"])
try await ndk.connect()

let signer = NDKBunkerSigner.bunker(ndk: ndk, connectionToken: bunkerString)

// Listen for auth URLs
Task {
    for await authUrl in signer.authUrlPublisher.values {
        print("Auth URL: \(authUrl)")
        // Open this URL in browser to authorize
    }
}

// Connect
let user = try await signer.connect()
print("Connected as: \(user.pubkey)")

// Sign an event
var event = NDKEvent(
    pubkey: user.pubkey,
    createdAt: Timestamp(Date().timeIntervalSince1970),
    kind: EventKind.textNote,
    tags: [],
    content: "Hello from NDKSwift NIP-46!"
)

try await signer.sign(event: &event)
print("Signed event: \(event.id ?? "")")
```

## Architecture Notes

1. **Actor-Based Concurrency**: The implementation uses Swift actors for thread-safe state management, ensuring safe concurrent access to the signer's internal state.

2. **RPC Communication**: All communication with the bunker happens through encrypted Nostr events (kind 24133) using either NIP-04 or NIP-44 encryption.

3. **Automatic Encryption Scheme Detection**: The implementation automatically falls back between NIP-04 and NIP-44 encryption schemes based on what the bunker supports.

4. **Connection State Management**: The signer maintains connection state and handles reconnection logic internally.

## Demo Applications

Created two demo applications:
1. **BunkerDemo.swift** - Comprehensive demo showing both bunker:// and nostrconnect:// flows
2. **TestBunker.swift** - Simplified test focusing on the provided bunker connection string

## Unit Tests

Created **NDKBunkerSignerTests.swift** with tests for:
- Bunker URL parsing
- NostrConnect URI generation  
- Auth URL publisher functionality
- Mock infrastructure for future testing

## Status

The implementation is complete and builds successfully. The library compiles without errors and includes all the necessary infrastructure to support NIP-46 remote signing in Swift applications.

The implementation follows Swift best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing NDKSwift architecture.
