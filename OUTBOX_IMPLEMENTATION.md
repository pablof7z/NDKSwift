# NDKSwift Outbox Model Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive outbox model implementation for NDKSwift, providing intelligent relay selection and management for Nostr applications.

## What Was Implemented

### Core Components

1. **LRUCache** (`Outbox/LRUCache.swift`)
   - Thread-safe actor-based LRU cache
   - TTL support for automatic expiration
   - Capacity-based eviction
   - Comprehensive test coverage

2. **NDKOutboxTracker** (`Outbox/NDKOutboxTracker.swift`)
   - Tracks relay information for users
   - Supports NIP-65 relay lists and contact list fallback
   - Blacklist support
   - Caches relay information with expiration

3. **NDKRelayRanker** (`Outbox/NDKRelayRanker.swift`)
   - Ranks relays by author coverage
   - Tracks relay health and performance
   - Configurable scoring preferences
   - Response time tracking

4. **NDKRelaySelector** (`Outbox/NDKRelaySelector.swift`)
   - Intelligent relay selection for publishing and fetching
   - Context-aware selection (mentions, replies, tags)
   - Relay combination optimization
   - Fallback relay support

5. **NDKPublishingStrategy** (`Outbox/NDKPublishingStrategy.swift`)
   - Manages event publishing with retry logic
   - POW (Proof of Work) support
   - Rate limiting handling
   - Real-time status tracking
   - Background publishing option

6. **NDKFetchingStrategy** (`Outbox/NDKFetchingStrategy.swift`)
   - Optimized event fetching
   - Subscription management
   - Event deduplication
   - Timeout handling

### Extensions and Integration

1. **NDKOutbox** (`Core/NDKOutbox.swift`)
   - Main integration point with NDK
   - High-level API methods
   - Configuration management
   - Cleanup operations

2. **NDKOutboxCacheAdapter** (`Cache/NDKOutboxCacheAdapter.swift`)
   - Extended cache protocol for unpublished events
   - Relay health metrics storage
   - Outbox item persistence

3. **NDKFileCacheOutbox** (`Cache/NDKFileCacheOutbox.swift`)
   - File-based implementation of outbox cache
   - Persistent storage for unpublished events
   - Relay health tracking

4. **Supporting Extensions**
   - `NDKEventExtensions.swift` - POW generation, tag extraction
   - `NDKRelayPoolExtensions.swift` - Relay pool helpers

### Comprehensive Test Suite

1. **Unit Tests**
   - `LRUCacheTests.swift` - Cache functionality
   - `NDKOutboxTrackerTests.swift` - Relay tracking
   - `NDKRelayRankerTests.swift` - Ranking algorithms
   - `NDKRelaySelectorTests.swift` - Selection logic
   - `NDKPublishingStrategyTests.swift` - Publishing flow
   - `NDKFetchingStrategyTests.swift` - Fetching logic

2. **Integration Tests**
   - `NDKOutboxIntegrationTests.swift` - Complete flow testing

## Key Features

### Publishing Features
- Automatic relay discovery based on mentions and context
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Proof of Work generation
- Rate limit handling
- Persistent unpublished event queue
- Background publishing support
- Real-time status tracking

### Fetching Features
- Optimal relay selection for authors
- Subscription deduplication
- Connection pooling
- Timeout handling
- Missing relay info tracking

### Performance Optimizations
- LRU caching with TTL
- Relay health tracking
- Connection reuse
- Minimal relay set calculation
- Concurrent operations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Publishing
```swift
// Publish with automatic relay selection
let result = try await ndk.publishWithOutbox(event)
```

### Advanced Publishing
```swift
let config = OutboxPublishConfig(
    minSuccessfulRelays: 3,
    maxRetries: 5,
    enablePow: true,
    maxPowDifficulty: 20
)
let result = try await ndk.publishWithOutbox(event, config: config)
```

### Fetching Events
```swift
let events = try await ndk.fetchEventsWithOutbox(
    filter: NDKFilter(authors: ["author1", "author2"])
)
```

### Subscription
```swift
let subscription = try await ndk.subscribeWithOutbox(
    filters: [filter],
    eventHandler: { event in
        print("Received: \(event.content)")
    }
)
```

## Configuration

The outbox model is highly configurable:

```swift
ndk.outboxConfig = NDKOutboxConfig(
    blacklistedRelays: ["wss://spam.relay"],
    defaultPublishConfig: OutboxPublishConfig(...),
    defaultFetchConfig: OutboxFetchConfig(...),
    autoRetryFailedPublishes: true
)
```

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Actor-based Concurrency**: Uses Swift actors for thread-safe state management
2. **Protocol-oriented Design**: Extensible through protocols
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
4. **Testability**: Comprehensive mocking support
5. **Performance**: Optimized for minimal relay connections
6. **Reliability**: Built-in retry and failure handling

## Breaking Changes

As requested, this implementation prioritizes clean code over backwards compatibility:
- New required methods in cache adapter protocol
- Modified relay pool visibility
- New event properties and methods

## Future Enhancements

The implementation is designed to support future additions:
- NIP-42 authentication
- Advanced relay scoring algorithms
- Relay recommendation system
- Analytics and metrics
- WebSocket connection pooling

This comprehensive outbox implementation brings NDKSwift to feature parity with other NDK implementations while leveraging Swift's modern concurrency features.
