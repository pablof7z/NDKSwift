# NDKSwift Examples

This directory contains example applications and demonstrations of NDKSwift functionality.

## Examples

### ðŸ“– StandaloneDemo.swift
A comprehensive API demonstration that shows all major NDKSwift features and usage patterns. This is a self-contained demo that doesn't require compilation.

**Run it:**
```bash
swift Examples/StandaloneDemo.swift
```

**Features demonstrated:**
- Bech32 encoding/decoding (npub, nsec, note)
- Event creation, validation, and signing
- Filtering and subscription patterns
- Relay connection management
- User profile handling
- Caching strategies
- High-level convenience APIs

### ðŸ“± BasicUsage.swift
Shows basic usage patterns for NDKSwift models and simple operations. Good starting point for understanding the core concepts.

### ðŸš€ NostrDemoMain.swift
A comprehensive console application that demonstrates real-world usage patterns. This is a compiled executable that shows all major NDKSwift features.

### ðŸ§ª SimpleDemoMain.swift
A minimal demo showing key functionality in a simple format. This is a compiled executable for quick testing.

### ðŸ’¾ FileCacheDemo.swift
Comprehensive demonstration of the file-based cache adapter, showing persistent storage, querying, profile management, and performance testing.

### ðŸŒ¸ BlossomDemo.swift
Complete demonstration of Blossom protocol support including:
- File upload to Blossom servers
- Server discovery (BUD-01)
- Upload with authorization (BUD-02)
- List and delete operations (BUD-03, BUD-04)
- Integration with Nostr events (NIP-94 file metadata)
- Image event creation with automatic Blossom upload

## Running the Examples

### Quick Start
The easiest way to see NDKSwift in action:

```bash
# Run the standalone API demo (no compilation needed)
swift Examples/StandaloneDemo.swift

# Or run the full test suite to see everything working
swift test
```

### Building and Running Compiled Examples
To build and run the compiled examples:

```bash
# Navigate to Examples directory
cd Examples

# Build the examples
swift build

# Run SimpleDemo
./.build/debug/SimpleDemo

# Run NostrDemo (comprehensive demo)
./.build/debug/NostrDemo

# Run FileCacheDemo (cache demonstration)
./.build/debug/FileCacheDemo
```

### Alternative: Run from Root Directory
```bash
# From NDKSwift root directory
swift run --package-path Examples SimpleDemo
swift run --package-path Examples NostrDemo
swift run --package-path Examples FileCacheDemo
```

## What You'll See

- **Overall**: 74/84 tests passing (88% success rate)

## API Highlights

### Basic Usage
```swift
import NDKSwift

// Initialize NDK
let ndk = NDK(relayUrls: ["wss://relay.damus.io"])

// Create events
let event = NDKEvent(
    pubkey: "your_pubkey",
    createdAt: Timestamp(Date().timeIntervalSince1970),
    kind: EventKind.textNote,
    content: "Hello Nostr!"
)

// Subscribe to events
let filter = NDKFilter(kinds: [1], limit: 20)
let subscription = ndk.subscribe(filters: [filter])

subscription.onEvent { event in
    print("Received: \(event.content)")
}
```

### Bech32 Support
```swift
// Encode/decode npub
let npub = try Bech32.npub(from: pubkey)
let pubkey = try Bech32.pubkey(from: npub)

// Encode/decode nsec
let nsec = try Bech32.nsec(from: privateKey)
let privateKey = try Bech32.privateKey(from: nsec)
```

### Async Streams
```swift
for await event in subscription.eventStream() {
    print("Event: \(event.content)")
}
```
