# Outbox Model Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

The outbox model has been successfully implemented for NDKSwift with the following components:

### Core Components
1. **LRUCache** - Thread-safe caching with TTL support
2. **NDKOutboxTracker** - Tracks user relay preferences with NIP-65 support
3. **NDKRelayRanker** - Intelligent relay scoring based on performance
4. **NDKRelaySelector** - Context-aware relay selection for optimal routing
5. **NDKPublishingStrategy** - Smart publishing with retry and POW support
6. **NDKFetchingStrategy** - Efficient data fetching from optimal relays

### Features
- ✅ NIP-65 (Relay List Metadata) support
- ✅ Automatic relay discovery from social graph
- ✅ Performance-based relay ranking
- ✅ Proof of Work (POW) generation
- ✅ Rate limit handling with backoff
- ✅ Unpublished event caching
- ✅ Concurrent operations
- ✅ Event deduplication
- ✅ Subscription management

### Integration
- Extended NDK with high-level outbox methods
- Added cache adapter extensions
- Created relay pool and relay extensions
- Comprehensive type system for configuration

### Usage
```swift
// Publish with outbox model
let result = try await ndk.publishWithOutbox(event)

// Fetch with optimal relays
let events = try await ndk.fetchEventsWithOutbox(filter: filter)

// Track user preferences
await ndk.setRelaysForUser(pubkey: pubkey, readRelays: [...], writeRelays: [...])
```

## Build Status
✅ All components compile successfully
✅ No build errors
✅ Ready for integration testing

## Next Steps
1. Run comprehensive test suite when test infrastructure is fixed
2. Create integration examples
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Documentation updates
