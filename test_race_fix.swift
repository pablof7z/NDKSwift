Race Condition Fix Summary:
=========================

The issue: "No relay subscription found for ID: 995171"

Root cause:
- NDKSubscriptionManager was sending REQ messages directly to relays
- Relay subscription managers didn't know about these subscriptions
- When EVENT/EOSE arrived, the relay couldn't find the subscription

The fix applied:
1. Updated NDKSubscriptionManager.executeRelayQueries() to use relay.subscriptionManager.addSubscription()
2. Removed the 50ms batching delay that was creating timing issues
3. Added registrationTask tracking to ensure subscriptions are registered before use
4. Made fetchEvents() wait for registration to complete

Key changes:
- NDK.swift: Added registrationTask to track subscription registration
- NDKSubscription.swift: Added registrationTask property
- NDKSubscriptionManager.swift: Now properly registers subscriptions with relay managers
- NDKRelaySubscriptionManager.swift: Removed problematic delay

Result: Subscriptions are now properly registered before any network operations occur.
