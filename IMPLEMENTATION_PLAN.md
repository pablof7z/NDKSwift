## Testing Infrastructure

### Test Utilities
1. **Mock Relay Server**: In-process relay for testing
2. **Event Factories**: Generate test events easily
3. **Time Helpers**: Control time in tests
4. **Assertion Helpers**: Custom assertions for Nostr types

### Continuous Integration
- Run tests on every commit
- Performance benchmarks tracking
- Code coverage reporting
- Integration with real relay tests

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use Swift's async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Prefer protocols over concrete types
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Document all public APIs

### Error Handling
- Define clear error types for each module
- Use Result types where appropriate
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle network failures gracefully

### Performance Considerations
- Use actors for thread-safe state management
- Implement efficient subscription grouping
- Optimize database queries
- Monitor memory usage in subscriptions

## Progress Tracking

Each phase will be implemented incrementally with:
1. Protocol/interface design
2. Core implementation
3. Comprehensive tests
4. Documentation
5. Performance optimization

Progress will be tracked through:
- Git commits for each feature
- Test coverage metrics
- Performance benchmarks
- Integration test results

## Success Criteria

Each phase is considered complete when:
- All unit tests pass (>90% coverage)
- Integration tests demonstrate feature completeness
- Performance meets defined benchmarks
- API documentation is complete
- Code review identifies no major issues
